# Sentiment-analysis of Amazon Reviews

In this project, we aimed to analyze the textual data present in form of customer reviews on Amazon.in for a specific product, end goal being to visualize and analyze the trends in various products of a particular company.

We automated the web scraping process of reviews of a product. In the next step, we created a naives bayes predictor and svm predictor on it to compare different accuracy scores.

The results were visualized using a confusion matrix and we were able to achieve an accuracy of 84% by combining various textual and general data preprocessing techniques such as lematization, smote analysis and k fold analysis and combining it with the right learning algorithm.
